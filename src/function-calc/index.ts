/**
 * @description This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. 
 *              Let's have a look at some examples:
 *              ```
                  seven(times(five())); // must return 35
                  four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
                  eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
                  six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
                ```
